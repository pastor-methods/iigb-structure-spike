The economic picture for inward investment is one of stability and long term growth. The UK’s creative industries grew by 8.9%t in 2014 - almost double the UK economy as a whole.

Britain is a gateway to the export markets of Europe and the world. Its creative sector is particularly export-focussed.

The sector:

- exported £19.8 billion of creative services in 2014, 9% of all UK service exports
- already attracts significant creative investment, making a major contribution to the UK’s position as the largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Europe.
- attracted 486 inward investment projects in 2014-5, in combination with the Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) sector

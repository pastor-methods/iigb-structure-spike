The UK’s creative talent pool is deep and wide. It’s one of the few places in the world with the skills

and infrastructure needed to produce major movies - Star Wars was filmed here.

Innovative fusions, between healthcare or music and virtual reality, or major players and new start

ups, thrive here.

There are strong reasons to set up or expand your creative business in the UK.

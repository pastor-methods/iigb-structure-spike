The UK’s creative talent pool is deep and wide. It’s recognised as a world class prospect for inward investment in:

-	film – its skills and infrastructure mean big budget movies like Star Wars can be made here 
-	music – talent and technology make it the world’s second biggest exporter (source: UK Music).
-	TV – the UK’s technicians, actors, location and production facilities make it a global leader
-	digital media and computer games – it has the largest games development sector in Europe (source TIGA)

Tax relief is driving growth in an already thriving sector. Well established creative networks mean that start-ups can access major players, and other creative partners.

There are strong reasons to set up or expand your creative business in the UK.

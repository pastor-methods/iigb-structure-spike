The UK is one of the easiest places in the world to develop the infrastructure and communications that ambitious creative companies need for growth. It has:

- one of the world&#39;s highest levels of broadband penetration
- world leading access to digital television and radio
- the biggest ecommerce market in Europe
- a huge appetite for new digital services, with high levels of take-up of new networks and devices

Almost all the major global technology businesses have operations here.

London is the hub of the UK&#39;s creative economy, ranked 2nd only to New York in EY&#39;s global talent index for 2015. That’s one of the reasons over two-thirds of international advertising agencies base their European headquarters in the capital.

Outside of London, the games development sector is thriving in Brighton, Cambridge, Dundee, Liverpool, Newcastle, the Midlands and Yorkshire.

Other creative and technology clusters across the UK include Manchester’s Media City and Leamington Spa

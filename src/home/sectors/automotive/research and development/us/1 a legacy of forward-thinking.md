The UK is at the forefront of developing the automotive technologies of the future, paving the way for even greater production growth, efficiency and connectivity. Expertise is provided through universities (4 out of the global top 8 universities can be found in the UK), state of the art research centres and through the many automotive manufacturers that call the UK home.
 
In 2012 alone, UK universities and research centres spent Â£1.7 billion on automotive related R&D. This investment is further supported by the Government, which offers funding opportunities at every stage of the manufacturing process.

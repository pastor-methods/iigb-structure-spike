The UK is a world leader in automotive lightweighting, and in 2015 the government provided £40 million of R&D funding to make vehicles lighter and more energy-efficient.
 
The [National Composites Centre](http://nccuk.com/) is one centre dedicated to investigating low weight carbon composites, whilst the [Affordable Composites Group](http://www.nccuk.com/ncc-news/affordable-composites-group-help-uk-exploit-booming-global-market-low-cost-high-volume) are working with the AIO to engage overseas companies in collaborative R&D.
 
Private companies are also investing in making cars lighter and faster. Jaguar Land Rover, based in the Midlands, is the world’s most revolutionary aluminium car manufacturer. The company’s UK factory are currently developing an all-new aluminium monocoque vehicle architecture that will reduce fuel consumption and increase crash safety.

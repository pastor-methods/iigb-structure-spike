The UK is the undisputed home of Formula 1. 9 out of the competition’s 11 racing teams are based here, including Mercedes AMG Petronas, whose recent F1 WO6 Hybrid car was the most dominant in the history of the sport.  

7 of the Formula 1 teams form part of the UK’s Motorsport Valley, which predominantly comprises the West Midlands and Oxfordshire and is renowned as the world’s largest cluster of competition-orientated engineering organisations.

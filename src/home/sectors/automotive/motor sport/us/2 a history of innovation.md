In motorsport every millisecond, millimetre and milligram matters, which is why the UK is committed to investing heavily in research and development. Indeed for over 50 years the UK has been responsible for more motorsport innovations than any other country, from the first use of disc brakes to the invention of KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System). 

That’s why the UK is home to some of the best motor racing test centres in the world. This includes Silverstone – home to the British Formula 1 Grand Prix – Donington, Brands Hatch and the Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground.

This appetite for innovation has already attracted 9 out of the 11 Formula 1 teams to establish a base in the UK, whilst even proud foreign manufacturers – like German juggernaut, Mercedes - recognise the UK’s expertise in automotive R&D and have opened centres here.
 
Other world-leading facilities include the [Advanced Propulsion Centre](http://www.apcuk.co.uk/), which specialises in low-carbon propulsion technologies, and the [Catapult](https://www.catapult.org.uk/) research centres, which help new and emerging technologies into market through a combination of public and private sector funding. Last year, the Government supported Catapults with over £250 million.
 
[Innovate UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk) also have a special interest in automotive advancements and offer significant funding to enable important R&D in the sector. In July 2016, they offered businesses £2.3 million for low carbon development and demonstration projects in the niche vehicle sector.

Low carbon initiatives are not just a great opportunity for the automotive sector - they’re also key to our global future. The UK is committed to pioneering new ways to lower carbon emissions, and the Advanced Propulsion Centre received £1 billion of funding to cultivate the UK as a world-leading centre for excellence in low carbon development. Their collaborative projects range from revolutionising battery packs to developing heavily down-sized, fuel-efficient petrol engines for electric cars.
 
Automotive giants, including Ford, Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover, are also developing low carbon technologies in their UK R&D centres. As a result, the UK is now also the largest EU manufacturer of electric vehicles and has the largest EU market for electric vehicles (25% and 20% of market share respectively).

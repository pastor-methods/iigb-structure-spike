The [Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/driverless-vehicles-connected-and-autonomous-technologies) was created to ensure that the UK is a pioneer in connected and autonomous vehicles. The Centre has been awarded £200 million of funding for R&D opportunities and continues to influence policy development in the industry.
 
And, given the global eagerness for ‘driverless’ cars, the UK have permissive regulations to ensure that R&D departments find it easy to test their vehicles.

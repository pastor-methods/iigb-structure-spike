If you want to come and work in the UK, you may need a visa. Only British nationals, European Union citizens, non-EU member states of the European Economic Area (EEA - Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland), Switzerland, and members of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) are exempt from needing one to enter the UK.

The UK offers a wide range of visas to suit your individual and company needs. 

We have over 200 visa application centres around the world, and applications take only half an hour to complete. 97% of these are processed within 15 days, with 98% of skilled worker visa requests granted.

Our automotive industry is experiencing unprecedented growth and has emerged as a leading location for global investment. In fact, car production rose 32% between 2012 and 2015 and will exceed 2 million cars by 2020. 

This is in part due to rising global demand for vehicles manufactured here, with 77% of British-built cars now exported to more than 100 countries. It’s also thanks to competitive manufacturing costs, strong technological capability and the highest productivity in Europe.

We’re developing the automotive technologies of the future, with a special focus on those that affect production growth, efficiency and connectivity. 

Our expertise comes from globally renowned universities, state of the art research centres, and the pioneering automotive manufacturers that call the UK home.

In 2012 alone, our universities and research centres spent £1.7 billion on automotive related R&D. This investment is further supported by the government, which offers funding opportunities at every stage of the manufacturing process.

Last year, UK automotive manufacturers spent £31 billion on components – and it’s estimated that they’re likely to source a further £3 billion more parts this year.

State of the art research centres, university partnerships and government funding commitments all contribute to the culture of automotive invention and innovation that makes the UK such a fruitful opportunity.

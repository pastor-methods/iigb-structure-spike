The UK automotive industry is experiencing unprecedented growth and has emerged as a leading location for global investment. In fact, car production rose 32% between 2012 and 2015 and will exceed 2 million cars by 2020. 

This is in part due to a rising demand for UK vehicles around the world – 77% of UK-built cars are exported to more than 100 countries – as well as competitive manufacturing costs, strong technological capability and the highest productivity in Europe.

To help overseas businesses take further advantage of this thriving industry, the Automotive Investment Organisation has been set up. Led by industry leaders and part of UK Trade and Investment, the organisation provides investors with knowledge and advice on topics ranging from financial support to identifying locations for manufacturing facilities.
